# ChessDisplay

This is a program to display chess pieces on a board. It is not intended to be a fully functional AI that can play a game, at least not at this point. The idea is that it can be used to represent various states of a board that is in game play, or that it could be used by a couple of players to enter moves manually using keyboard or mouse input. 

This is a personal project used mainly for learning purposes.
