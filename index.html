<h1>Chess</h1>
<h2>What am I doing here?</h2>
<p>I am going to experiment with coding while I am also learning chess. I could blog about what I am learning, so I would be figuring out how to set up a blog site. </p>
<p>I was thinking that I would create a chess board using CSS. That is probably something I will do no matter what. I don't think I could make a game that actually plays chess, like an AI. However, couldn't I make a chess board, then put pieces on the board? At first they could be just letters, like p, r, kn, b, qu, and ki. Evenutally I could figure out some kind of graphic to use. Moves could be typed in at first also. </p>
